1. Shape Area Calculator Using Inheritance:
===========================================
Create a base class named "Shape"
Include a method named calculateArea() that outputs a general message like:
"Area not defined for generic shape."

2. Create the following derived classes:
Circle:
=======
Data member(private): radius
Override calculateArea() to compute area using π × radius²

Rectangle:
==========
Data members(private): length, width
Override calculateArea() to compute area using length × width

Triangle:
=========
Data members(private): base, height
Override calculateArea() to compute area using 0.5 × base × height


3. Constructor(public):
Each derived class must include a constructor to initialize its data members.

4. In the main() function:
Create one object of each shape.
Call their calculateArea() method to print the area.
Employee Salary System Using Inheritance:
=========================================
1. Define a base class named "Employee":

Attributes:
name (string)
id (int)
baseSalary (float)

Constructor(protected):
=======================
* to initialize the instance variables.
2
Functions(protected):
calculateSalary() → prints base salary only.
display() → prints name, id, and salary (by calling calculateSalary()).

2. Create a derived class "Manager":
Additional attribute(private): bonus (float)
Constructor:
============
Create Constructor and call the Parent Constructor by passing parameters and initialize the remaining attributes.

Override calculateSalary() → salary = baseSalary + bonus
Override display() → prints name, id, and total salary

3. Create a derived class "Developer":
Additional attribute(private): overtimePay (float)

Constructor:
============
Create Constructor and call the Parent Constructor by passing parameters and initialize the remaining attributes.

Override calculateSalary() → salary = baseSalary + overtimePay
Override display() → prints name, id, and total salary

4. In the main() function:
Create one Manager and one Developer object using hardcoded values.
Call their respective display() methods to show full details and computed salaries.
